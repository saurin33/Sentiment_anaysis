Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted.@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?.@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night \"as fast as they can\", you should reconsider what you think that means..@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United.@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead.@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty.@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach..@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck..@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life.

Your airline messed up both ways of our trip..@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx.@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016.@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info..@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!.@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars.@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky.@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds.@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS.@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter.@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!.@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!.@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??.@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold..@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic.@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away.@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)..@united it will be on a different airline..@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved..@united clicked \"upgrade now\" and it didn't upgrade.

Would love to see some seriousness here..@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do.@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united.@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?.@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco.

I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy.@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?.@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed..@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed.@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it 😃.@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!.@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then.@JetBlue @julesdameron \"Considering?\" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality.@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars.@JetBlue Thank you. Fingers crossed...@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're \"watching\" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars.@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay.

Scheduled departure 8:15p..@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification.@JetBlue oh right!

No announcements at the gate. What's going on?.@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given.@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?.@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;).@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is..@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA??.@JetBlue hey JetBlue.

Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?.@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying.@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers.@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether.@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue.@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG.@JetBlue okay.

Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI..@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight..@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated..@JetBlue This is absurd.

Very, very unhappy with you right now..@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8.@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting..@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!.@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2.@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing.@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay.
